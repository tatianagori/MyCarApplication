-- UPDATE -- I had some issues with my application towards the end and I did not manage to fix the errors, I had Invocation target exceptions that I could not identify,
therefore I could not
demonstrate my application in the video. However, I created another simple application with the same layout, fragments and activities, with the sole purpose of having content
and demonstrate 
what my application was supposed to do and better talk about its functionalities. -- UPDATE -- 

This application is intented for users with personal cars to check details about their cars, such as when to change oil, tires, water, filters, do inspection and much more.
This will help, especially drivers with little to no car experience to be safe and keep their cars in good condition. 
The idea behind this application came up beacuse as a driver myself, it is hard to keep up with everything that I need to keep in mind when owning a car and many times it came up that I wore out car parts to the point where it was not save to drive anymore, and as I spoke with other drivers, I realized there are many others with the same issue that could be solved easily just by creating an application where everything is stored and organized in a way that makes our lives easier.
